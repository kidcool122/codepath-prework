## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.!
This was my first time working with swift or XCode so it was very frustatrating at the start, but it ended up pretty fun once I saw my app working properly. I hope in the future the modify and style the app better for user satisfaction. But I believe it all comes with more knowledge.
